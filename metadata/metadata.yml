  This capsule is designed to curate spike sorted data for the AIND pipeline.

  It uses a quality metrics based recipe to flag units as passing or failing default quality control (QC).

  The recipe is based on the following quality metrics:
  - isi violation ratio < 0.5
  - presence ratio > 0.8
  - amplitude cutoff < 0.1

  In addition, the capsule automatically labels units as "noise"/"mua"/"sua" based on the a pre-trained
  random forest classifier (UnitRefine).
